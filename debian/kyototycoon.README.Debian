Kyoto Tycoon for Debian
-----------------------

By default Kyoto Tycoon will use a hash database with a bucket size of 1000000.
To tune your database, set a custom DBNAME in /etc/default/kyototycoon. See
ktserver(1) or kyototycoon-doc for details.

In the default file you can also setup things like replication, async update log
writes, debugging and more.

The init script defaults to use unix sockets if SERVERHOST or SERVERPORT is not
set. This is different from what upstream does, which defaults to port 1978. All
tools have been changed to reflect this change.

Kyoto Tycoon is packaged in a way to allow you to run more than one instance on
the same machine. The name of the server is based on the symlink for the init
script. When this package is upgraded or removed, only the original server will
be restarted. Make sure to manually bring other instances down and up.

Example of how to setup a new instance:

  ln -s /etc/init.d/kyototycoon /etc/init.d/kyototycoon-other
  update-rc.d kyototycoon-other defaults

For special configurations for that instance, edit /etc/default/kyototycoon-other
